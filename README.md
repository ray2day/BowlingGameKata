# BowlingGameKata
Bowling Game Kata repository

June 2022. When gaining work experience as a volunteer at BEE-ideas, my trainer advised me to get into learning clean coding. So I bought the book Clean Coding, it is the only book and the holy grail / bible of clean coding written by Robert C. Martin, Uncle Bob himself. This book teaches the reader to think about coding and gives advice to develop software in a more efficiently / Agile way. It is a very thick book and though it is interesting it has some tough matter. So half way through, still busy reading it, I asked my teacher if he had something more hands-on. So for the time not reading, he gave me this challenging The Bowling Game-kata. An assigment to learn more about Test Driven Development. I think it was not an easy assigment. This repository exists of the final code after building/doing several tests using the red-green-refactoring approach.
